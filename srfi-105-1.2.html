<p>Lisp-based languages, like Scheme, are almost the only
programming languages in modern use that do not support infix notation.
Adding standardized infix support to Scheme would eliminate a common
complaint by developers who currently choose to use other languages.
Scheme currently reserves <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>
&ldquo;for possible future extensions to the language&rdquo;.
We propose that <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> be used
to support &ldquo;curly-infix&rdquo; notation as a homoiconic
infix abbreviation,
as a modification of the Scheme reader.
It is an abbreviation in much the same way that
<samp>&apos;x</samp> is an abbreviation for <samp>(quote&nbsp;x)</samp>.
</p>
<p>
A <dfn>curly-infix list</dfn> is a list whose visual presentation is in
infix order instead of prefix order.
For example,
<samp>{n&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;2}</samp> maps to <samp>(&gt;&nbsp;n&nbsp;2)</samp>,
and
<samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;+&nbsp;c}</samp> maps to
<samp>(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)</samp>.
By intent, there is no precedence, but e.g.,
<samp>{x&nbsp;+&nbsp;{y&nbsp;*&nbsp;z}}</samp>
maps cleanly to
<samp>(+&nbsp;x&nbsp;(*&nbsp;y&nbsp;z))</samp>.
Forms with mixed infix operators and other complications have
&ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; prepended to
enable later macro processing, e.g.,
<samp>{2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;*&nbsp;5}</samp>
maps to
<samp>(nfx&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;*&nbsp;5)</samp>.</p>

<p>Note that this is the first of three tiers developed by the
&ldquo;<a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net/">readable</a>&rdquo; project. We intend to later submit two more
SRFIs, to define two other tiers that build on top of
curly-infix-expressions (namely, neoteric-expressions and
sweet-expressions). However, curly-infix-expressions are useful on
their own, even without these other notations.</p>

<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
<p>Lisp-based languages, like Scheme, are almost the only
programming languages in modern use that do not support infix
notation. Even some Lisp advocates, like Paul Graham, admit that
they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t find prefix math expressions
natural&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html"
rel="nofollow">http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html</a>).
Paul Prescod has said, &ldquo;I have more faith that you could convince
the world to use Esperanto than prefix notation&rdquo;
(<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg01571.html" rel="nofollow">http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg01571.html</a>).
Infix is not going away; standard mathematical notation uses infix,
infix notation is taught to most people (programmers or not) in school,
and nearly all new programming languages include infix.
Adding infix support to Scheme would eliminate a common complaint
by developers who currently choose to use other languages instead.</p>
<p>Scheme currently reserves
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> &ldquo;for possible future
extensions to the language&rdquo;. We propose that
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> be used to
support &ldquo;curly-infix&rdquo; notation as a reader
abbreviation, just as
<samp>&apos;x</samp> is an abbreviation for <samp>(quote&nbsp;x)</samp> and
<samp>(x&nbsp;y&nbsp;z)</samp>
is an abbreviation for
<samp>(x&nbsp;.&nbsp;(y&nbsp;.&nbsp;(z&nbsp;.&nbsp;())))</samp>.
</p>
<p>This proposal is an extremely <em>simple</em> and
<em>straightforward</em> technique for supporting infix notation.
There is no complex precedence system, all other Scheme
capabilities (including macros and quasiquoting) work unchanged,
any symbol can be used as an infix operation where desired,
and Scheme remains general and homoiconic.
Curly-infix-expressions (also known as c-expressions)
are just a convenient reader abbreviation for infix notation.</p>
<p>At its core, this SRFI provides
the <em>simple</em> curly-infix list that accepts ordinary
lists, merely written in a different order.
The simple curly-infix list
<samp>{operand-1 operator operand-2 operator operand-3 operator ...}</samp>
is mapped to
<samp>(operator operand-1 operand-2 operand-3 ...)</samp> so that more than
two operands are handled cleanly.
E.g., <samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;+&nbsp;c}</samp> maps to
<samp>(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)</samp>.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_changereader">Why not macros or radically different reader notations?</h2>
<p>Many previous systems have implemented &ldquo;infix&rdquo;
systems as a named macro or procedure (e.g., <var>INFIX</var>).
This looks ugly, and it does the wrong thing &dash; the resulting list
always has <var>INFIX</var> at the beginning,
not the actual infix operator, so this
approach can interfere with quoting, macros, and other capabilities.
</p>
<p>Other systems build notations into the reader, but the
infix notation would be a notation radically different from
normal Lisp notation.
The result, in some cases, would be that these notations would
simultaneously lose Lisp&rsquo;s abilities for
quoting, quasiquoting, and so on, and these notations were
not homoiconic.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, this curly-infix-expression proposal avoids these problems.
For example, in curly-infix,
<samp>`{,a&nbsp;+&nbsp;,b}</samp>
maps cleanly to
<samp>`(+&nbsp;,a&nbsp;,b)</samp>,
which works as expected with all macros.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_noprecedence">Why isn&rsquo;t precedence part of this SRFI?</h2>
<p>Many past &ldquo;infix&rdquo; systems for Lisp build in
precedence. However, Lisp systems often process other languages,
and they may freely mix these different languages.
Thus, the same symbol may have different meanings
and precedence levels in different contexts.
The symbol might not even be defined where it is being
used, and allowing precedence definitions would create subtle errors
if files are read in a different order.
If users hook in their own precedence system into a reader, it could
even become difficult to combine code written for different precedence systems.
In short, building precedence into a
Lisp reader creates many complexities.</p>
<p>Yet the complexity of precedence systems is often unnecessary.
In practice, we&rsquo;ve found that simple infix is all
that&rsquo;s needed most of the time in Lisp-based languages.
Even in other languages, many developers unnecessarily use
grouping symbols with infix operators to make their order clear.
Thus, requiring grouping symbols is less of a
hardship than it might appear.</p>
<p>By intentionally <em>not</em>
building a precedence system into the reader,
a very simple yet useful infix system results.
We don&rsquo;t need to register procedures, ensure that declarations
of precedence precede their use, or anything like it.
We also ensure that the notation is clearly homoiconic.</p>
<p>Instead, where precedence is desired, application and library writers
can implement precedence by defining and controlling the scope of an
&ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; macro or procedure, or by later postprocessing
of that symbol.
Scheme macros are already quite powerful and capable of handling this;
in these cases, <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> provides a more
convenient notation.
The curly-infix approach, instead of trying to manage both infix
and precedence, handles simple cases and then
takes advantage of the existing Scheme scoping rules and macro system for
more complex cases (in the rare cases where they are needed).</p>
<p>It would be possible to extend curly-infix to provide a full fixed
precedence system (e.g., if an expression is mixed,
attempt to use various precedence rules).
However, such capabilities would be extensions
not required by this SRFI.
See the discussion on <var>transform-mixed-infix</var>, below.</p>
<p>Note that curly-infix includes support for unary operators, but again,
they are without precedence.
As a result, they must be grouped separately.
This does not lead to hard-to-read expressions, however.
Examples of simple curly-infix lists combining infix and unary operations
include
<code>{(-&nbsp;x)&nbsp;*&nbsp;(-&nbsp;y)}</code>
and
<code>{{-&nbsp;x}&nbsp;*&nbsp;{-&nbsp;y}}</code>.
Another notation that builds on curly-infix (namely, neoteric-expressions)
can make unary operators even easier to use.</p>
<p>At first David A. Wheeler, who started this project,
considered reporting an error if a simple infix
expression isn&rsquo;t provided.
However, prepending &ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo;
is much more flexible.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_noautodetect">Why not autodetect infix?</h2>
<p>Some past efforts tried to automatically detect infix operators,
but this turns out to not work well. It&rsquo;s hard to express
good rules for detecting infix operators, and the rules become too
complex for users (e.g., &ldquo;punctuation-only symbols&rdquo;
doesn&rsquo;t detect &ldquo;<var>and</var>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<var>or</var>&rdquo;).
And in
any case, if they were automatically detected, an escape mechanism
would be needed anyway. Allowing the user to expressly notate when
infix was intended, using <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>,
turns out to be far more clearer
and more intuitive. In particular, curly-infix allows the use of
infix with any symbol, whenever you want... and where it&rsquo;s
not convenient, you don&rsquo;t need to use it. It is also very
backwards-compatible: Normal lists work normally, and if you want
infix, use <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_specialcases">Why are 0, 1, and 2 parameters special?</h2>
<p>The empty curly-infix list
<samp>{}</samp> maps to <samp>()</samp>,
as it <em>is</em> an
empty list, and this is the likely user meaning (reducing
unnecessary errors).</p>
<!-- dwheeler says: I think we have to mention n-expressions and t-expressions
here, because they are part of the rationale for these semantics. -->
<p>The one and two parameter cases are defined in part to reduce user error,
and in part to better support other notations
that build on top of curly-infix-expressions (namely, neoteric-expressions and
sweet-expressions):
</p>
<ol>
<li>An &ldquo;escaping&rdquo;
<samp>{e}</samp> is mapped to <samp>e</samp>
so that the neoteric-expression
<samp>f{x}</samp> becomes the likely-intended <samp>(f x)</samp>, and to
provide an easy escape mechanism in sweet-expressions for symbols
that would otherwise have other meanings.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;unary-operation&rdquo; curly-infix list
<samp>{e&nbsp;f}</samp> maps to <samp>(e&nbsp;f)</samp>,
so that
<samp>{-&nbsp;x}</samp> maps to <samp>(-&nbsp;x)</samp>,
the likely interpretation, and also so that the neoteric-expression
<samp>f{-&nbsp;x}</samp> will map correctly to
<samp>(f&nbsp;(-&nbsp;x))</samp>.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="rationale_transformmixedinfix">What is <var>transform-mixed-infix</var> good for?</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;<var>transform-mixed-infix</var>&rdquo; procedure is not
intended for use in normal software development. Instead, it is
suggested so that a future SRFI author could more easily implement
a fixed precedence system that is built into the reader. We think
that precedence is overrated. However, if a future community
decides it wants precedence built into the reader,
<var>transform-mixed-infix</var> could be redefined to provide one.
Similarly, the mapping requirement for mixed curly-infix lists
is intentionally worded to allow additional mappings of mixed
curly-infix lists to handle precedence (so an implementation can
legitimately say they implement curly-infix-expresssions even if they
have such additional mappings).
The mapping of mixed curly-infix-expressions and the
&ldquo;<var>transform-mixed-infix</var>&rdquo; procedure are
only defined to help simplify implementing a plausible future SRFI.
The &ldquo;<var>transform-mixed-infix</var>&rdquo; procedure is
not required or expected to be used in normal cases.
Application software developers should avoid
redefining <var>transform-mixed-infix</var>.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_delimiters">Why must infix operators be delimited?</h2>
<p>Curly-infix requires that the infix operators be delimited (e.g., by
spaces). This is consistent with Lisp history and current practice.
Currently, in Lisp, operators are always
delimited in traditional s-expressions (typically by left
parentheses on the left, and by whitespace on the right).
It&rsquo;s impractical to do otherwise today; most Lisps,
including Scheme, allow and predefine symbols that include characters (like
&ldquo;<var>-</var>&rdquo;) that are typically used for infix operators.
Many developers put space around infix operators even in languages
that don&rsquo;t require them, so syntactically requiring them is no burden.
In short, it is difficult to allow infix operators
without delimiters, and the visual results are the same as many
real-world uses in other languages, so the result appears quite
customary to typical software developers.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_curlyfooconvention">Why the <var>curly-foo</var> convention?</h2>

<p>There needs to be a way for users to easily enable curly-infix
for the default reader (e.g., <var>read</var>), read-eval-print loop (REPL),
and loader (e.g., <var>load</var>).
We would like implementations to enable curly-infix in their normal
invocation, but some implementors may not want to do that.
For example, if an implementation already uses braces for a
different local extension, they may not want to immediately
switch to curly-infix in their default invocation.
Thus, if implementors choose to not enable curly-infix in their default
reader, a conventional command line name &ldquo;<var>curly-foo</var>&rdquo;
is defined for each implementation <var>foo</var> that enables it.</p>

<p>There is simply no single option flag (for example) that
everyone could agree on to enable this.
In practice, we expect that implementations will build this into their
default readers and then control it via some special flag, but we do
not want to mandate exactly how it is turned on or passed.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_procedures">Why the procedures <var>enable-curly-infix</var> and <var>curly-infix-read</var>?</h2>
<p>
Early drafts of this SRFI <em>required</em> support for an
&ldquo;<var>enable-curly-infix</var>&rdquo; procedure to enable
curly-infix.
But some implementations may have difficulty changing basic infrastructure
(like the reader and loader) once they have started up.
Thus, this procedure is not required, but
simply <em>may</em> be available.
This provides a simple convention for users who want to enable curly-infix,
without leaving the system, on those systems where this is sensible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no explicit &ldquo;<var>disable-curly-infix</var>&rdquo;.
There&rsquo;s no reason to disable it within this SRFI, and if some
other action changes the meaning of braces, it would be that other
action that disables it.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<var>curly-infix-read</var>&rdquo; procedure allows reading
external curly-infix data, even if the implementation doesn&rsquo;t
enable curly-infix-expressions by default but does support
curly-infix-expressions.</p>
<p>By intent, this SRFI (including the enabling mechanism)
doesn&rsquo;t use or interact with any module system at all
(including the R6RS and R7RS module systems). This is because some
implementations won&rsquo;t have a module system (or at least not a
standard one). Curly-infix is an intentionally simple mechanism
that can be built into even trivial Scheme implementations.
Mandating module support is unnecessary and might inhibit its
adoption.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_racketinfixconvention">What about the Racket &ldquo;infix convention&rdquo;?</h2>
<p><a href=
"http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Pairs__Lists__and_Racket_Syntax.html">
Racket allows a notation called the &ldquo;infix convention&rdquo;
with the form &ldquo;<code>(a . operation . b)</code>&rdquo;</a>. An
advantage of this alternative is that it does not use the braces,
so it might be easier to implement in Schemes which already define
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> in a local extension. However, the Racket &ldquo;infix
convention&rdquo; has many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Racket infix convention is much longer and more awkward
than curly-infix notation. In the Racket infix convention, every
infix operator adds 6 characters. Infix operations are a very
common operation, so convenience matters. An expression like
<samp>(1&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;2)</samp>
is far longer, and less convenient, than
<samp>{1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2}</samp>.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t look like other languages or math. A human
notation should be maximally understandable to people given what
they already know.
The notation <samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b}</samp>
is much more similar to the standard notation
&ldquot;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&rdquot; than
<samp>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;b)</samp>.</li>
<li>It is easy to make mistakes. If you forget a &ldquo;<code>.</code>&rdquo;
somewhere, you end up with the wrong result, and possibly without an
error being flagged. This notation also
makes it harder to see improper lists; improper lists are important
but rare, so it&rsquo;s good to make them obvious - the Racket
infix convention makes improper lists hard to distinguish. The
Racket documentation even goes out of its way to emphasize that
infix convention use is unrelated to improper lists... which
suggests that they are easily confused.</li>
<li>Without <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>, <samp>{x}</samp> is no longer useful as an escape mechanism
for sweet-expressions (a notation that builds on curly-infix). An
alternative would be to use <samp>(. x)</samp> as an escape mechanism,
but at that point dots-in-lists become busy and confusing.</li>
<li>Racket&rsquo;s implementation, according to its documentation,
does not allow multiple operations,
e.g.,
<samp>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;b&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;c&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;d)</samp>.
That could be added,
but using them makes the Racket infix convention even more
unwieldy. For example, compare
<samp>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;b&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;c&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;d)</samp>
to
<samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;+&nbsp;c&nbsp;+&nbsp;d}</samp>.</li>
<li>Even Racket users don&rsquo;t use this convention often. Its
documentation says that &ldquo;Racket programmers use the infix
convention sparingly&mdash;mostly for asymmetric binary operators
such as <var>&lt;</var> and <var>is-a?</var>&rdquo;.
The documentation does not say why,
but its extra length and awkwardness may be part of the reason.
In any case, the fact that the Racket documentation recommends that it
be used &ldquo;sparingly&rdquo; does not encourage wider adoption.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, cases where infix notation would be useful are
extremely common, so its notation should be convenient.
The Racket &ldquo;infix convention&rdquo; may be the
next-best notation for infix notation after curly-infix, but
it&rsquo;s next-best, and we should strive for the <em>best</em>
available notation for such a common need.
Curly-infix does not <em>conflict</em> with the
Racket infix convention; implementations could implement both.
We recommend that an implementation that
implements the Racket infix convention should also allow multiple
operands and use curly-infix semantics for them, pretending that
<samp>.&nbsp;op&nbsp;.</samp>
is a single parameter.
In that case,
<samp>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;b&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;c)</samp>
would map to
<samp>(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)</samp>,
and
<samp>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;b&nbsp;.&nbsp;*&nbsp;.&nbsp;c)</samp>
would map to
<samp>(nfx&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;*&nbsp;c)</samp>.
Note that the existence of the Racket &ldquo;infix
convention&rdquo; is additional evidence of the <em>need</em> for a
standard infix convention; many have separately created mechanisms
to try to provide infix support.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_six">What about Gambit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scheme Infix eXtension (SIX)&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>
The Gambit reader includes a notation called the
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/doc/gambit-c.html#Scheme-infix-syntax-extension">&ldquo;Scheme Infix eXtension (SIX)&rdquo;</a>
that supports infix notation. SIX expressions begin with a backslash.</p>

<p>Like curly-infix, SIX is a reader extension.
But SIX has a number of problems compared to curly-infix:
</p>
<ul>
<li>SIX has a long, complex grammar, requiring users to remember a complex grammar, and requiring a far more complex implementation.  Curly-infix, by contrast, is extremely simple.</li>
<li>SIX is inflexible.  It only supports a fixed set of operators, and
users cannot easily use other operators inside its notation.
SIX even defines a small set of types and control structures
which cannot be extended.
People can easily create new operations;
it&rsquo;s important that an infix system
be able to immediately use them.</li>
<li>SIX does not generate standard Scheme expressions, and thus it does
not interact well with macros and quoting.
SIX generates special markers when given infix expressions, and they
must then be processed later for use.
For example, in SIX, using an infix <samp>+</samp> in the input
generates <samp>six.x+y</samp>, not <samp>+</samp>, in the read result.
This means that macros may have to be specially designed to work with SIX.
In contrast, in curly-infix, <samp>{x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y)</samp> actually
generates <samp>{+&nbsp;x&nbsp;y)</samp>, so curly-infix works in a better
way with other macros and with quoting rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Like Racket, SIX does demonstrate that there is a <i>need</i> for
an infix notation that can be used in Scheme.
</p>

<p>A system could simultanously implement curly-infix and SIX.
However, curly-infix is far simpler, is more flexible (e.g., by allowing
arbitary symbols), and works much more easily with macros and quoting.
Thus, we believe that curly-infix is the better system and more
appropriate for standardization across Scheme implementations.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_guile">What about Guile 1.4&rsquo;s &ldquo;reading infix&rdquo; module?</h2>
<p><a href="http://gnuvola.org/software/guile/doc/index.html">Guile 1.4.x
at gnuvola.org</a> is self-described as a
&ldquo;(somewhat amicable) fork from the official Guile&rdquo;.
It includes
<a href="http://gnuvola.org/software/guile/doc/Reading-Infix.html">support
for reading infix expressions</a>.
Once activated, infix expressions are surrounded by #[ and ].
Infix are surrounded by whitespace.
It supports precedence, which sounds like an advantage,
but operators must be registered before use (and few are predefined),
creating an opportunity for terrible errors if the expression
is read first.
There is also the opportunity for serious problems if different programs
are written assuming different precedence levels.
Inside the infix notation a very different language is used
(e.g., parentheses are used for grouping instead of necessarily
creating lists, and parameters are separated by commas),
so it is unclear how well
it would work with other Scheme features such as quasiquotation.
</p>


<p>The guile 1.4 reading infix module has a more complex grammar
requiring a more complex implementation and understanding.
Its registration system creates serious problems when trying to use it
for larger systems.
This infix notation has not been accepted into the version of
guile used by most people, so it is very much not portable.
But perhaps the biggest problem is that this notation is fundamentally
not homoiconic; it is harder to determine where lists begin and end
with it.</p>

<p>In contrast, curly-infix is simpler,
requires no registration system or other complexities,
works more clearly with macros and quasiquotation, and
has the general advantage of being homoiconic.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_otherdetails">Other details</h2>
<p>There is no requirement that writers (e.g., &ldquo;<var>write</var>&rdquo;
or a pretty-printer) write out curly-infix-expressions. They may
choose to do so, e.g., for lists of length 3-6 whose car is the
symbol &ldquo;<var>and</var>&rdquo;,
the symbol &ldquo;<var>or</var>&rdquo;, or a
punctuation-only symbol. However, it would probably be wise to wait
until many implementations can handle c-expressions.</p>
<p>Curly-infix is designed so that it can work on other Lisps as
well. We even have a working implementation in Common Lisp.</p>
<p>Curly-infix is an unusually simple mechanism, but like much of
any Lisp-based language, its power comes from its simplicity.</p>

<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>
<p>&ldquo;<dfn>Curly-infix-expressions</dfn>&rdquo; (c-expressions) are
s-expressions with an additional notation: The curly-infix list.
A curly-infix list is syntactically identical to a normal list,
except it is surrounded by curly braces instead of by parentheses.
Once a curly-infix list is read, it is mapped differently than a
regular list by a curly-infix reader:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <dfn>simple</dfn> curly-infix list has an odd number of
parameters, at least three parameters, and all even parameters are
&ldquo;<var>eq?</var>&rdquo; symbols. A simple curly-infix list is mapped by
the reader into a list with the even parameter followed by the odd
parameters.
E.g.,
<samp>{n&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;2}</samp>
maps to
<samp>(&lt;=&nbsp;n&nbsp;2)</samp>,
and
<samp>{2&nbsp;*&nbsp;3&nbsp;*&nbsp;4}</samp>
maps to
<samp>(*&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4)</samp>.</li>
<li>The <dfn>empty</dfn> curly-infix list
<samp>{}</samp> is mapped to the empty list <samp>()</samp>.</li>
<li>An <dfn>escaping</dfn> curly-infix list
<samp>{e}</samp> is mapped to <samp>e</samp>.
E.g., <samp>{5}</samp> is mapped to <samp>5</samp>.</li>
<li>A <dfn>unary-operation</dfn> curly-infix list
<samp>{e1&nbsp;e2}</samp>
is mapped to
<samp>(e1&nbsp;e2)</samp>.
E.g.,
<samp>{-&nbsp;x}</samp>
maps to
<samp>(-&nbsp;x)</samp>.</li>
<li>The mapping of a curly-infix list beginning with the symbol
&ldquo;.&rdquo; is unspecified.
(Note: the reference implementation maps
<samp>{.&nbsp;e}</samp> to <samp>e</samp> if
<samp>(.&nbsp;e)</samp> maps to <samp>e</samp>.)
</li>
<li>Any other curly-infix list (including all other improper lists) is
<dfn>mixed</dfn>.  Unless overridden by some other specification,
a mixed curly-infix list is mapped to the list with the symbol
&ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; added to its front.
E.g.,
<samp>{q&nbsp;+&nbsp;r&nbsp;*&nbsp;s}</samp>
is mapped to
<samp>(nfx&nbsp;q&nbsp;+&nbsp;r&nbsp;*&nbsp;s)</samp>, and
<samp>{q&nbsp;+&nbsp;r&nbsp;.&nbsp;s}</samp>
is mapped to
<samp>(nfx&nbsp;q&nbsp;+&nbsp;r&nbsp;.&nbsp;s)</samp>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some examples of c-expressions (note all operators in curly-infix are delimited):</p>
<ul>
<li><samp>{a * {b + c}}</samp> maps to <samp>(* a (+ b c))</samp></li>
<li><samp>{x eqv? `a}</samp> maps to <samp>(eqv? x `a)</samp></li>
<li><samp>{(- a) / b}</samp> maps to <samp>(/ (- a) b)</samp></li>
<li><samp>{(f a b) + (g h)}</samp> maps to <samp>(+ (f a b) (g h))</samp></li>
<li><samp>&apos;{a + (f b) + x}</samp> maps to <samp>&apos;(+ a (f b) x)</samp></li>
<li><samp>{{a &gt; 0} and {b &gt;= 1}}</samp> maps to
<samp>(and (&gt; a 0) (&gt;= b 1))</samp></li>
</ul>

<p>A <dfn>curly-infix reader</dfn> is a datum reader
that can correctly read and map curly-infix-expressions.
A curly-infix reader <em>must</em>
include the braces &ldquo;<code>{</code>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<code>}</code>&rdquo; as delimiters.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<dfn>standard readers</dfn>&rdquo;
are the datum reader used by the REPL,
the datum readers defined by the relevant Scheme standards
(such as &ldquo;<var>read</var>&rdquo; and where applicable
&ldquo;<var>get-datum</var>&rdquo;),
and the readers used to load user-supplied code
as defined by the relevant Scheme standards
(e.g., the reader used by &ldquo;<var>load</var>&rdquo;
and module-loading mechanisms for user code).</p>
The standard readers are <dfn>curly-infix enabled</dfn> if the standard
readers are curly-infix readers.</p>

<p>
An implementation of this SRFI <em>must</em>
have its standard readers be curly-infix enabled.
We encourage implementations&rsquo; <em>default</em> invocation to
have their standard readers be curly-infix enabled,
but this is <em>not</em> required.
If the standard readers are not curly-infix enabled
in an implementation&rsquo;s default invocation,
then if it can be invoked from a command line via the command
&ldquo;<var>foo</var>&rdquo;, the implementation
<em>must</em> provide an alternative command &ldquo;<var>curly-foo</var>&rdquo;
(the command prefixed with &ldquo;<code>curly-</code>&rdquo;) in which
its standard readers <em>are</em> curly-infix enabled.
In addition, if the implementation is invokable as a graphical user interface
(GUI), it
<em>must</em> provide a documented means to ensure that its
standard readers are curly-infix enabled.
</p>

<p>When determining if a curly-infix list is simple or not,
an implementation <em>may</em> allow the even parameters to be non-symbols,
and it <em>may</em> use a more generous equality test
(such as <var>equal?</var>); if it does, it
<em>should</em> terminate even if the even parameters contain cycles.
An implementation <em>may</em> perform a different mapping for
a mixed curly-infix list (e.g., by implementing precedence
using <var>transform-mixed-infix</var> as described below).
</p>

<p>Procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementations <em>may</em> provide the procedure
<var>(curly-infix-read .  port)</var> as a curly-infix reader.</li>
<li>Implementations <em>may</em> provide the procedure
<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var>,
which on completion would ensure that the
standard readers are curly-infix enabled.
If implemented, this procedure <em>must</em> allow users to safely invoke
<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var> repeatedly.</li>
<li>Implementations <em>may</em> provide an overrideable procedure
<var>(transform-mixed-infix lyst)</var> that can be
&ldquo;<var>set!</var>&rdquo;. This
procedure would receive a mixed curly-infix list and return a
transformation of it. By default, this function returns the
original list but with &ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; in front.
Application developers <em>should not</em> use, define, or
redefine this function; it is merely suggested to simplify
implementation of plausible future SRFIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If an implementation supports SRFI 55 require-extension, then
<samp>(require-extension (srfi 105))</samp> <em>should</em> implement
the functionality of <var>enable-curly-infix</var>.
Similarly,
if an implementation imports the module <samp>(srfi 105)</samp>, then
it <em>should</em> have the same effect as <var>enable-curly-infix</var>.
</p>

<p>Note that, by definition, this SRFI modifies lexical syntax.</p>

<h1 id="reference-implementation">Reference implementation</h1>
<p>The implementation below is portable, with the exception that
Scheme provides no standard mechanism to override
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> in its
built-in reader. Thus, implementations will typically have a
modified reader that detects &ldquo;<code>{</code>&ldquo;, starts reading a list
until its matching &ldquo;<code>}</code>&rdquo;, and then calls <var>process-curly</var>
defined below. We recommend that implementations <em>always</em> do
this, but an implementation must at least activate this behavior
when &ldquo;<var>curly-foo</var>&rdquo; is invoked
(if invoking <var>foo</var> on the command like would invoke the
implementation without curly-infix).
This is also enabled by
<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var> if supported.</p>
<p>This reference implementation is SRFI type 2: &ldquo;A
mostly-portable solution that uses some kind of hooks provided in
some Scheme interpreter/compiler. In this case, a detailed
specification of the hooks must be included so that the SRFI is
self-contained.&rdquo;</p>
